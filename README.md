# Agda-for-Programmers

Here is the material for my course at IMT Atlantique about Agda for programmers.

FIL software engineering apprenticeship program (http://www.imt-atlantique.fr/formation/ingenieur-par-apprentissage/ingenieurs-specialite-ingenierie-logicielle). This 3-year program leads to a Master's degree in software engineering at IMT Atlantique.

About 30 students each year.

Half a day block = I program in front of the students for 75 minutes, then the students get my code and complete it for 150 minutes.
There are 8 blocks. 
I evaluate the last (8th) block.
Total time = 30h.

The code is presented in two different versions:

1. In LiterateExo: (`.lagda.md`) literate markdown 
  https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.3/tools/literate-programming.html#literate-markdown
  I could not load this format in my Agda installation. Yet it renders
  nicely on github. It is the one you wish to browse online.

2. in AgdaExo: (`.agda`) plain Agda without markdown (the markdown as comments lines are erased)
  This format loads fine in my Agda installation. It can be used to
  focus on code.
